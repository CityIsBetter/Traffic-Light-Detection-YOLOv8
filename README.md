TRAFFIC LIGHT DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION

PROJECT OVERVIEW : 

The Traffic Light Detection and Classification project aims to enhance autonomous driving systems by providing accurate traffic light detection and classification. The model is designed to generate appropriate physical responses for vehicles equipped with it. This project is part of a larger hardware initiative that is still under development, focusing on the practical implementation of the model.

INSTALLATION AND DEPENDENCIES: 

Please refer to the requirements.txt file for a comprehensive list of dependencies required to run this project.

FEATURES: 

Autonomous detection and classification of traffic lights
Generates appropriate responses based on detected traffic lights
Integrates with hardware systems for practical implementation


DATA: 

Approximately 30% images collected by the team
Remaining images sourced from the internet
A total of 1713 images used for training, validation, and testing
Images were augmented to triple the original dataset size. Cropping, Rotation, Adjustment of brightness levels and adjustment of noise levels in the images were part of the augmentation process.
The dataset maintains an almost equal ratio of all classes for training and testing, with minor differences
Challenges and Solutions
One major challenge encountered was false positive detections. This issue was addressed by incorporating appropriately labeled negative images into the training dataset.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION: 
Final accuracy levels and performance metrics are detailed in the performance evaluation files.
